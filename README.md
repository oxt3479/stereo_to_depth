Implementation takes samples from Inria 3DMovie Dataset (In its current implementation):




The Inria 3DMovie Dataset contains all the stereo pairs and their annotations
used in our ICCV 2013 paper [1]. Most of this data was extracted from the
"StreetDance 3D" [Giwa and Pasquini, 2010] and "Pina" [Wenders, 2011] stereo
movies. Some of the negative stereo pairs were harvested from Flickr and were
originally shot using the Fuji W3 camera. The dataset includes stereo pairs,
ground truth segmentations, poses and person bounding boxes, and is split into
a training and test parts.
